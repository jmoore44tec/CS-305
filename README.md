Software Security coursework
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
- Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Because of this, security is a top priority, handling highly sensitive information. Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations. As a crucial part of the success of its custom software, the company also wants to use the latest and most effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). The company is seeking Global Rain’s (my fictional employer) expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
- I was able to accurately find false positives when examining the dependency reports as well as spot vulnerabilites with my eyes by simply looking over the code itself. Coding securely is crucial for many reasons, most importanly protecting sensitive information whether it be the company's or the consumer, as well as developing and maintaining that trust with consumers that products produced by me will not leave them vulnerable to attack.
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
- The actual deployment of the alogrithm cipher was challenging and took me some time to grasp, but that is mostly because of my unfamiliarity with them and Eclipse itself.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
- By deploying algorithm ciphers within my code, handpicked based on funcitionality, I was able to bolster the security of my program.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- Running my program and monitoring its deployment, as well as checking for vulnerabilites throughout the process was incredibly important.  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- Dependency checks were incredibly important in determining softwares vulnerabilities. I will be sure to revisit this.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
- The work shown here displays my resilience and dedication to safety, security, and following best practices according to industry standards.
